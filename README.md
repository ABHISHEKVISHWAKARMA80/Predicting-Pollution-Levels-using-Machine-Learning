# Predicting-Pollution-Levels-using-Machine-Learning

Data consist of two csv files :-
1. Train.csv
2. Test.csv

Train:- The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column.All the feature columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

Test:- test data consist all the columns contained by train with the the exception of target column which I have predict using the model trained on train data.

In 'Code_for_Prediction.ipynb', I have applying the concept of Linear Regression (of Multiple Features) and save the predicted value in 'prediction.csv'.

# Regression

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

# Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

# Multiple linear regression (MLR)

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.
