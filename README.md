# Predicting-Pollution-Levels-using-Machine-Learning

Data consist of two csv files :-
1. Train.csv
2. Test.csv

Train:- The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column.All the feature columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

Test:- test data consist all the columns contained by train with the the exception of target column which I have predict using the model trained on train data.

In 'Code_for_Prediction.ipynb', I have applying the concept of Linear Regression (of Multiple Features) and save the predicted value in 'prediction.csv'.
