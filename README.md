# Predicting-Pollution-Levels-using-Machine-Learning

Data consist of two csv files :-
1. Train.csv
2. Test.csv

Train:- The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column.All the feature columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

Test:- test data consist all the columns contained by train with the the exception of target column which I'm predicted using the model trained on train data.

In 'Code_for_Prediction.ipynb', I'm applying the concept of Linear Regression (of Multiple Features) and save the predicted value in 'prediction.csv'.

# Regression

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

Regression analysis can handle many things. For example, you can use regression analysis to do the following:

-Model multiple independent variables

-Include continuous and categorical variables

-Use polynomial terms to model curvature

-Assess interaction terms to determine whether the effect of one independent variable depends on the value of another variable

# Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

# Multiple linear regression (MLR)

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.

# when we have to use linear regression

a) The dependent variable Y has a linear relationship to the independent variable X.

b) when we want to predict a continuous dependent variable from a number of independent variables. 

c) The residuals are independent, meaning the residuals are distributed randomly and not influenced by the residuals in previous observations.

d) The data is homoskedastic, meaning the variance in the residuals (the difference in the real and predicted values) is more or less constant.
